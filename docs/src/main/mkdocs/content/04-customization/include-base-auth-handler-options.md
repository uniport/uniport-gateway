| Variable | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `publicKeys` | Yes | Array | An array of Public Keys. Each element (Public Key) in the array is an object with the fields `publicKey` and optionally `publicKeyAlgorithm`. The `publicKey` value is a public key in PEM format (without header/footer) or a URL for retrieving the public key from Portal-IAM (e.g., http://portal-iam:8080/auth/realms/portal). The OIDC Discovery mechanism is used for this, and all public keys found under the `jwks_uri` URL that are used to create a signature are loaded. If the `publicKey` contains a public key in PEM format, the `publicKeyAlgorithm` value can also be set; otherwise, the default `RS256` is used. |
| `issuer` | Yes | String | Value that the `sub` claim in the JWT must possess. |
| `additionalIssuers` | No | Array | An array of additional Issuers. If other Issuers besides the main `issuer` are relevant, they can be declared in this array. |
| `audience` | Yes | String | Value that the `aud` claim in the JWT must possess. |
| `claims` | No | Array | An array of requirements that each JWT must fulfill. Each element (requirement) in the array is an object with the fields `claimPath`, `operator`, and `value`. The `value` at the path `claimPath`, specified as JSONPath ([https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base/)) in bracket-notation, is compared with the claim in the JWT at that path according to the `operator`. The following operators are currently supported:<br/><br/>`EQUALS`: The value in the JWT claim must match `value`.<br/>`CONTAINS`: The value in the JWT claim must be contained in `value`. `value` must necessarily be specified as a list\!<br/>`EQUALS_SUBSTRING_WHITESPACE` and `CONTAINS_SUBSTRING_WHITESPACE`: Instead of specifying `value` as a list, elements can be separated by whitespace. |
| `publicKeysReconciliation` | No | Object | An object with the two fields `enabled` and `intervalMs`. By default, `enabled` is `true` and `intervalMs` is `600000` (1h). Basically, the `bearerOnly` middleware loads the current Public Keys used by Portal-IAM to sign JWTs from Portal-IAM when the Uniport-Gateway starts. The Public Key Reconciler can automatically update the Public Keys at a defined interval. This ensures that in the event of a key rollover, the Uniport-Gateway does not need to be restarted, but automatically knows and accepts the new Public Keys. Additionally, in the case of an `Unauthorized` Request (401), the Public Keys are automatically updated and the Request is repeated _once_. This ensures that JWTs signed with a new Public Key, but where the reconciliation interval has not yet expired, can still be verified. |
